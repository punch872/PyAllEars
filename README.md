## Eavesdropping and Sentimental analysis of what is being heard/found online.

#### How to implement this?

Using a Raspberry pi (to make is more portable) with an atatched microphone to record what is being talked in the surrounding.

Using all the resources available online, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram(InstaBro can be used in mac) to collect data about what is being talked about.

After that using the context of the sentence sentimental analysis is done.

#update#

No need to conduct eavesdropping in realtime since it is not needed.
Eavesdropping should be done in software ( Python ).
It should also be done only in public accounts
For example, if a KanyeWest concert wants to see how and what people think about him/the concert, you could use the # to search in Instagram, twitter or even on Facebook.
Instagram would yeild the best result since people use hashtags more frequently in instagram than anything else.
This is good since then we can attach an image too with the python software.

THIS PROJECT IS PAUSED FOR NOW - will resume in June 2018
